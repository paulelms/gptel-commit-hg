;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides functions to generate commit messages using GPTel.
;; It analyzes staged changes and generates appropriate commit messages following
;; conventional commit formats.
;;
;; Main functions:
;; - `gptel-commit': Generate commit message directly
;; - `gptel-commit-rationale': Generate with optional context/rationale
;;
;; The package supports streaming responses and excludes specified file patterns
;; from diff analysis to focus on relevant changes.

;;; Code:

(require 'gptel)
(require 'cl-lib)

(defgroup gptel-commit nil
  "Generate commit messages with GPTel."
  :group 'vc
  :group 'gptel)

(defcustom gptel-commit-stream t
  "Whether to stream commit message generation.
Set to nil if your backend doesn't support streaming."
  :type 'boolean
  :group 'gptel-commit)

(defvar gptel-commit-prompt
  "You are an expert at writing commit messages.
Generate **only** the commit message, nothing else.

DECISION PROCESS:
1. Count changed files
2. If 1 file: check if change is simple or complex
3. Apply the appropriate format

FORMAT RULES:

A. Single File + Simple Change (one clear purpose):
   * path/to/file: Description. (≤72 chars)

   NO subject line, NO blank lines, JUST this one line.

B. Single File + Complex Change (multiple purposes/major refactor):
   Subject line (≤50 chars, imperative mood, NO period)

   Optional body paragraph explaining why (wrap at 72 chars).

   * path/to/file (func1, func2): Description.

C. Multiple Files (2+ files changed):
   Subject line (≤50 chars, imperative mood, NO period)

   Optional body paragraph explaining why (wrap at 72 chars).

   * path/to/file1 (func1): Description.
   * path/to/file2 (func2): Another description.

D. Trivial Changes:
   Add `; ` prefix for typos/comments/docs.
   Example: `; * file: Fix typo.`

SIMPLE vs COMPLEX (single file):
- Simple: one function, one clear fix/addition
- Complex: multiple functions, refactoring, or architectural change"
